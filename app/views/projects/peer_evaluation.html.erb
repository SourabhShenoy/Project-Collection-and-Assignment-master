<h1>Peer Evaluation</h1>

<p> Please assign a score to each of the team members (<em><strong>including yourself</strong></em>) according to the amount and quality of work done for the project. Use the provided space to justify your score. </p>
<p> You can assign a total score of <b> <%= @members.size * 10 %> </b> among all team members, including yourself. </p>



<p>NOTE: You should make your judgment based on the entire project, not just recent activity (or lack thereof); also consider things like document writing and leadership (not just coding and testing), and give people some credit for at least making an effort (i.e. think carefully before giving someone a very low score).</p>
